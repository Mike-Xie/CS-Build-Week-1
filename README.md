This is a manual implementation of the K-Means algorithm done for Lambda School Build Week Unit 1.

The implementation is in the k_means file and a small test and plot are in K_Means_Plot.

TO USE:

Import k_means. 

Run fit on your data set which should be a 2 dimensional numpy array like the example in K_Means_Plot. Then you can run predict on a single data point with the same number of rows as your numpy array and it'll tell you which centroid is closest/cluster it belongs to. 

TO DO:

Test speed of various things that calculate magnitude:
